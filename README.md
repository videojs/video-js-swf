Installation
============

* You will need a copy of the Flex 4+ SDK in order to build this project.  A copy can be pulled from [here](http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flex/flex-sdk-download-all.html).  Place it in the location of your choice.

* Open up build.sh and modify "/Developer/SDKs/flex_sdk_4/bin/mxmlc" to point to the location of the mxmlc file on your file system.

* Type sh build.sh into your terminal.  The SWF should be built into the bin-release folder.
